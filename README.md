Renal Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict renal failure from clinical data. The aim is to identify individuals at high risk of developing renal failure based on various medical parameters.

1.  Project Overview:

Renal failure, or kidney failure, is a serious health condition that can lead to life-threatening complications if not detected early. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for early diagnosis of renal failure using patient health data.

2.  Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains medical records, including patient demographics, clinical tests, and lifestyle information. It includes features such as:

Age, gender, weight, and height

Blood pressure, glucose levels, creatinine levels

Past history of diseases such as diabetes or hypertension

3.  Project Workflow:

  Data Collection: Acquire and clean the dataset.

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand the data.

  Feature Engineering: Select and create relevant features for the model.

  Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize features, and split data into training and testing sets.

  Model Building: Implement and train machine learning models.

4.  Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.

  Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search to optimize model performance.

  Deployment: Deploy the trained model for practical use (optional).

5.  Models Used:

  Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated for this task, including:

  Logistic Regression

  Random Forest

  Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  XGBoost

  Neural Networks
